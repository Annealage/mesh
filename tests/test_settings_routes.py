"""In-process HTTP contract tests for ``GET`` and ``PUT /settings``.

Separate from ``tests/test_settings.py`` by subject, the way
``tests/test_models_signature.py`` is separate from
``tests/test_models_watcher.py``: that file pins how four layers resolve into
one value, this one pins the surface a browser reaches that resolution
through, including the token gate it shares with ``/ws`` and the refusals that
must survive being reachable over a network rather than only from a function
call.

Two properties here are not about resolution at all and are the reason this
route exists in the shape it does. A ``GET`` reports what **this run** is
using, never a value freshly read off disk, because reporting the file would
claim a port the server is not listening on; and anything saved that differs
appears under ``pending``, because a settings window that could not confirm
its own write would be useless. Both are asserted below against a real write.
