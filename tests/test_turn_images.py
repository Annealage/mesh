"""Tests for ``session/turn_images.py``, the dual delivery plan section 2's
verified fact 6 requires, driven through ``SdkSession`` and a fake
``Transport`` the same way ``tests/test_sdk_session.py`` does (fact 11).

``SdkSession.submit_turn`` is the one place a turn's blocks leave this
process; every assertion here reads ``transport.written``, the JSON line the
SDK actually wrote, rather than a private helper's return value, so a defect
in how ``_expand_turn_blocks``'s result is threaded through ``query()`` would
still be caught here even if the expansion itself were correct in isolation.

This file duplicates ``test_sdk_session.py``'s small ``FakeTransport``/
``EventRecorder`` harness rather than importing it: ``tests/`` has no
``__init__.py``, so its modules are not import targets for each other, and
each test file in this suite is self-contained the same way
``tests/test_upload.py`` carries its own image-byte helpers instead of
reaching into a sibling test module for them.
