"""On-demand live integration test for ``session/omp.py``: proves the real
``omp_rpc.RpcClient`` (not ``tests/test_omp_session.py``'s ``FakeRpcClient``)
can authenticate against a real, already-configured `omp` provider and
complete one real text-only turn (plan: ``phase7_live-integration-tests.md``).

Skips at collection time, with a clear reason, unless the ``omp`` CLI is on
``PATH``. Excluded from every default ``pytest`` run by ``pyproject.toml``'s
``addopts = "-m 'not integration'"``; run this tier explicitly with
``pytest -m integration``.

**No ``local_base_url``/config synthesis.** ``OmpSession`` supports two
modes (``session/omp.py``): given a ``base_url``, it synthesizes its own
throwaway custom-provider config for an arbitrary, self-hosted endpoint
`omp` does not already know about. Given no ``base_url``, it instead passes
``model`` straight through to `omp`'s own ``--model`` flag untouched, using
whatever providers this host's `omp` is already configured with -- the same
"provider/model" reference (``"titan/qwen3.8-27b"``) a human would type at
the CLI. This test deliberately exercises the second mode: it constructs no
custom provider, sets no ``PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`` override, and needs no
base URL or API key of its own, because "titan" is already a provider this
host's `omp` knows about, with its own credentials.
