"""Tests for the credential-path refusal in ``session/secret_paths.py``.

Three groups, and the third is the point of the file as much as the first two.

What must be refused: the direct spelling, a relative path, a symlink planted
inside the project, and a bash command naming the path in any of the forms a
shell expands itself. Writes as well as reads, since a write into
``~/.ssh/authorized_keys`` is the worse outcome of the two.

What must not be refused: everything else. A control that fires on ordinary work
gets turned off, so the tests that pin non-interference are load-bearing rather
than decorative, and they include the paths that merely look similar.

What is known not to be covered: the bash check is textual, so a glob, an
encoding, or a command that walks to the directory before naming the file gets
through. A path held in a variable happens to be caught when the assignment
spells it out, which is incidental rather than an understanding of shell
variables. Those cases are asserted as *allowed*, so
the limit is written down in the suite rather than only in a docstring, and so a
later change that claims to close the gap has to update a test that says it is
open.

``HOME`` is redirected per test, so nothing here reads or refuses against the
developer's own credential directories.
