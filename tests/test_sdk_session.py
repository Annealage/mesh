"""Tests for ``session/sdk.py``, driving the real ``ClaudeSDKClient`` through
a fake ``Transport`` (plan section 2, fact 11: a six-method ABC, injectable
as ``ClaudeSDKClient(options=..., transport=...)``).

This is the only file in the suite that imports ``claude_agent_sdk``'s
client directly rather than going through ``session/fake.py``, and it
exists as a canary: if an SDK upgrade renames a message field, changes
what a ``PermissionResult`` must look like, or reshapes the control
protocol's wire dicts, a test here breaks before that reaches a running
agent. What it pins matters more than how much of ``sdk.py`` it exercises.

``FakeTransport`` never spawns a process and never opens a socket; that is
true by construction, not by hoping, because it is a plain ``Transport``
subclass backed by an ``asyncio.Queue`` and its ``connect()`` never calls
anything outside this module. The ``_no_real_transport`` fixture below is a
second, independent guarantee: it makes the SDK's own
``SubprocessCLITransport`` raise if anything ever falls through to it, which
would otherwise mean a real ``claude`` binary got spawned by a test.

``EventRecorder`` gives each test an ``asyncio.Queue`` of the ``AgentEvent``
objects ``SdkSession`` emits, alongside a plain list of everything seen so
far, so a test awaits the next event deterministically instead of guessing
how many ``asyncio.sleep(0)`` hops the fake protocol layers need.

    """Pinning a defect, left failing on purpose: ``submit_turn`` never
    successfully delivers a turn to a real ``ClaudeSDKClient``.

    ``submit_turn`` calls ``self._client.query({"type": "user", ...})``,
    a plain dict. ``ClaudeSDKClient.query()``'s ``prompt`` parameter is
    typed ``str | AsyncIterable[dict]``: it checks
    ``isinstance(prompt, str)`` and, when that is false, falls through to
    ``async for msg in prompt:`` on the assumption that anything else
    passed in is already an async iterable of messages. A plain dict has
    no ``__aiter__``, so that line raises
    ``TypeError: 'async for' requires an object with __aiter__ method,
    got dict`` before a single byte reaches the transport.

    ``submit_turn``'s own ``except Exception as exc: self._fail(exc, ...)``
    then treats that TypeError as an agent failure: it marks the whole
    session unavailable and emits an ``AgentError``, rather than the turn
    reaching the model. Every call to ``submit_turn`` against the real SDK
    hits this; ``session/fake.py``'s stand-in never calls
    ``ClaudeSDKClient.query()`` at all, so nothing exercises this path
    outside a test built on the real client, which is what this file is
    for.

    Once fixed (wrapping the message in a one-item async generator, or
    passing the string form ``query()`` accepts directly), this assertion
    should hold: the session stays ready and the wire carries the turn.
