"""Tests for the pause switch: the frame, the event, and what it actually gates.

The switch is only worth having if the refusal happens in the server, where the
tools run, so these tests follow it end to end within one process: an inbound
``pause`` frame moves the flag on the ``ViewerBus``, the flag is announced to
every viewer, and a mesh tool that changes something, built on that same bus,
then refuses. The previous version of this control changed a checkbox and
nothing else, which every test of the browser alone would have passed.

This matters more than it did when the switch was designed. The tools that move
the camera and hide parts are pre-allowed, so no approval card stands in front
of them: this switch is the human's only control over them, rather than a
convenience on top of one.

``_dispatch`` is called directly, as in ``tests/test_permission_frames.py``: the
frame has already been validated by then, so a real socket would add a handshake
without adding anything to the question of what the layer does with the frame.
