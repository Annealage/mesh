"""Tests for how ``http/ws.py`` answers a ``permission`` frame that decides nothing.

Two browser views can hold the same permission card, and both can be clicked.
One of them decides the request; the other's frame arrives for a request that is
already resolved. The property under test is that the loser is told, because a
swallowed refusal renders a human's Deny on an already-allowed request
identically to a Deny that took effect, and that is the one outcome this path
must never produce.

``_dispatch`` is called directly rather than through a real socket: the frame
has already been validated by the time it gets there, so a socket would add a
handshake and a protocol version exchange without adding anything to the
question of what the layer does with the exception.
