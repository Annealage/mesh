"""In-process HTTP contract tests for ``POST /upload``.

Exercises the route registered by ``http/routes_chat.py`` through microdot's
``TestClient``. Covers the token gate ``/upload`` shares with ``/ws``; the
``kind`` whitelist that keeps a client's own naming choices out of the
written filename; the streaming Content-Length checks a non-buffered body
requires (missing, over the image cap, and shorter than declared); sniffing
that decides an upload's type from its bytes rather than its header or its
declared kind; and the containment and collision-retry behaviour
``create_unique_image_file`` and ``create_image_file`` enforce on
``images/``.
