"""Tests for ``viewers.py``: pending-call correlation, primary election,
and the backpressure policy in ``ViewerRegistry._enqueue``.

Every test that needs to inspect a connection's outbound queue in a known
state first stalls that connection's writer task with ``_stall_writer``:
cancel it and await the cancellation landing, so nothing ever again calls
``queue.get()``. That is the "fake writer that never drains" the M4 brief
asks the backpressure tests to be driven through. It is deliberately not a
substitute writer coroutine, because the real writer task started by
``ViewerRegistry.add`` is what a stalled browser's connection actually has;
stopping it dead is the simplest correct model of a socket nobody is
reading from, and it leaves the queue's raw contents exactly as
``_enqueue`` left them, which every assertion below depends on. Frames
already queued by ``add``/``touch`` themselves (a connection's own
``viewer_primary`` announcement) are cleared out where a test needs to
isolate what one later call to ``broadcast``/``call`` produced.

Every backpressure assertion checks which frames survive and which do not,
never only a queue length: a test that merely proves the queue stayed at
or under its cap says nothing about whether the policy dropped a
``ping`` or, wrongly, a ``turn_end``.

Pending-future immediacy is asserted by checking ``future.done()`` the
statement after ``await registry.remove(...)`` returns, with no
intervening sleep and a deliberately huge injected ``timeout`` (so a test
that regressed to "wait it out" would hang the suite rather than pass by
accident): ``Future.set_exception`` marks a future done synchronously, so
this is a direct check of the immediate-failure path, not a race against
the timeout it is supposed to make irrelevant.
