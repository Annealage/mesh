"""Tests for the ``/ws`` auth trio (token, Origin, Host) and the close-frame
encoder those checks are expected to use once refused.

A bug in this path is not a UI bug: ``/ws`` is the one route a browser tab
turns into a live channel that drives an agent (plan section 3.3), so a
check that can be bypassed here is a remote-code-execution bug once M5
lands. Every refusal below is asserted by driving a real HTTP exchange
through microdot and reading the status code back, not by calling an
internal predicate and checking its return value; a predicate can be right
while the route that is supposed to call it is wired wrong, or not wired at
all.

Ground truth this file is built on, established by source-reading microdot
2.6.2 and by encoding real frames rather than trusted from a docstring:

  1. ``WebSocket.close()`` takes no arguments and always sends an empty
     CLOSE frame; a coded close (4400, 1013, ...) can only be sent by
     building the frame by hand, which is what ``protocol.close_with_code``
     does.
  2. A pre-handshake auth failure (missing/wrong token, disallowed Origin,
     mismatched Host) refuses before ``websocket_upgrade`` runs, as an
     ordinary HTTP error response, never as a close code: there is no
     WebSocket connection yet at the point any of these three checks runs,
     so there is nothing to send a close frame on.
  3. ``websocket_upgrade(request)`` can be called from partway through a
     route, after auth checks already ran, rather than only via the
     ``with_websocket`` decorator wrapping the whole route.
  4. ``TestClient.websocket()``'s fake socket discards every outbound frame
     whose opcode is not TEXT or BINARY (``FakeWebSocket.awrite``). A test
     that opens a connection through ``TestClient.websocket()`` and then
     asserts on a close code is asserting on a frame the harness itself
     never delivered; such a test cannot fail even if the server sends the
     wrong code, or none at all, which makes it worse than no test. Every
     assertion here about a close code instead either (a) reads the status
     code of the pre-handshake HTTP response for the refusal cases, where
     no WebSocket frame is involved at all, or (b) drives a raw byte
     buffer through ``app.dispatch_request`` directly (``_RawSock`` below)
     and reads the literal bytes an ``awrite`` call was given, for the one
     case (protocol version mismatch) where a close code is sent after a
     successful upgrade.
  5. ``max_message_length`` must be set explicitly; not exercised by this
     file since it is a ``viewers.py``/``ws.py`` backpressure concern, not
     an auth one.

One further quirk found empirically while building this file, not among
the five above: a server ``send()`` issued before the server's own first
``receive()`` is also silently dropped by ``TestClient.websocket()``,
because its fake socket only starts recording sent frames once ``read()``
has been called at least once. This is a second, independent reason
``TestClient.websocket()`` is unsuitable for asserting anything about what
a freshly-upgraded connection sends before it has read anything, on top of
the opcode filtering in fact 4.

The M4 brief's own bind-mode section (line 94, in this repo's copy) says an
unlisted Origin is refused "with close code 4403"; verified fact 2 above
says all three auth checks refuse before the handshake, never as a close
code. This file treats fact 2 as authoritative, since the brief states
outright that the five verified facts were established by source-reading
and are not to be second-guessed against other prose in the same document.
Every Origin-refusal test below therefore asserts an HTTP status, not a
close code 4403, and this contradiction should be reconciled in the brief
by whoever owns it.

No server-side implementation exists yet to test against:
``src/annealage_mesh/http/ws.py`` and ``src/annealage_mesh/net.py`` are
both entirely absent from this tree, and ``app.py``'s ``create_app`` has
not been extended with the parameters M4 needs. Every test below is
written against an assumed extension of ``create_app``'s signature,
documented here since nothing else documents it yet:

    create_app(serve_dir, *, token, host="127.0.0.1", port=8765,
               extra_origins=())

registering a ``/ws`` route whose auth checks read ``token`` from the
``t`` query parameter, compute the allowed Origin set from ``host`` and
``port`` (plus ``extra_origins``) the same way ``net.allowed_origins``
does in ``test_bind_modes.py``, and validate the inbound ``Host`` header
against ``host``:``port``. Each test builds its app through the
``make_client`` fixture below rather than importing anything at module
level, so a signature that does not match this assumption fails each test
individually, with the ``TypeError`` naming the actual mismatch, rather
than one collection error hiding every property this file pins.
