"""ViewerRegistry: every browser tab's WebSocket connection, one primary
among them for ``call`` frames, and the backpressure policy that keeps a
slow tab from stalling everyone else's events.

``http/ws.py`` is the only expected caller: it registers a connection with
``add`` on a successful upgrade, calls ``touch`` on every inbound frame so
recency tracks real interaction, feeds inbound ``result``/``error`` frames
to ``resolve_call``, and calls ``remove`` from its own connection loop's
``finally`` block. Nothing in this module reads a socket; it only ever
writes to one, through the one writer task each connection gets.

Multi-viewer is convenience, not collaboration (plan section 5): several
tabs belonging to one human, not several people. That is why exactly one
connection is ever "primary" and why nothing here attaches identity to an
event beyond the tab id ``session.base.AgentEvent.viewer`` already
carries.

        On a full queue, a ``ping`` about to be enqueued is simply
        dropped: the next one is seconds away and a client's liveness
        check tolerates a missed beat, so it is never worth evicting
        something else to make room for it. For anything else, a queued
        ``ping`` is evicted first to make room, since it is the one frame
        kind this registry ever discards outright. If that frees no slot
        (nothing queued was a ping) and the incoming frame is a
        ``text_delta`` event, it is folded into a same-turn delta already
        queued instead of taking a new slot; growing one delta's text
        costs nothing a queue slot would. ``call``, ``permission_request``
        and ``turn_end`` frames are never sacrificed to either relief:
        a lost call is a model waiting on a reply that will never come, a
        lost permission request is a decision the model made that the
        human never saw, and a lost turn_end leaves the browser believing
        a turn is still running. When neither relief frees room, the

        replays every missed event from ``seq`` rather than silently
        losing some of them.

        are ``broadcast``, which enqueues to every connection in one loop,
        and ``call``, which enqueues to a single connection and then
        awaits a reply future of its own. Awaiting a coded close inline
        would await a send on the very socket that got a connection here
        in the first place, and a peer whose TCP window is full may not
        error out on that send for as long as the platform's retransmit
        timers run; ``broadcast`` would then stall on one connection's
        close before it ever reached the next one in its loop. The close
        and the removal are handed to a detached task instead, returned
        here so ``broadcast`` can still wait for it once every connection
        in its own loop has had a turn (see ``broadcast``'s docstring);
        ``call`` has no use for the return value, since its own pending

        ``text_delta`` already queued, in place of adding a second item.

        Searched from the tail end, not the head: the queue is drained
        head-first, so the *last* same-turn delta already queued is the
        one chronologically nearest to ``frame``. Appending to an earlier
        one instead would splice ``frame``'s text into the middle of the
        turn's stream, ahead of whatever a later, still-queued delta for
        the same turn already holds, reordering the text a reader sees.

        The scan stops the moment it reaches a non-delta frame, matching
        the writer's own coalescer (``_run_writer``), which flushes
        ``pending`` before sending any non-delta frame: a non-delta frame
        already queued behind some earlier same-turn delta means that
        delta will reach the browser before whatever the non-delta frame
        represents (a tool call, a permission request, a turn ending), so
        collapsing ``frame`` into it would deliver ``frame``'s text
        alongside content the browser must see first. Falling through to
        the overflow close in that case is correct: nothing here can
        collapse ``frame`` in without reordering something.

        Replaces the queued item outright (by index, into the deque)
        rather than mutating the dict found there: every frame handed to
        ``_enqueue`` is this connection's own copy (``broadcast`` and
        ``call`` never share one dict object across two connections), so
        mutating in place here would be safe on that account too, but
        rebuilding the dict keeps this method correct even if a future
        caller of ``_enqueue`` ever changes that.

        The merged frame carries ``frame``'s own seq, for the same reason
        the writer's coalescer does: the merged text already includes
        everything up to that point, so a client resuming from this seq
        must not be replayed text this frame already delivered.

    inbound ``pause`` frame, ``http/ws.py`` sets the flag through this object,

    the human sees in the topbar is then a display of a decision recorded
    here, not the decision itself.

    Read-class tools are deliberately not gated. Pausing exists so the human
