"""Microdot route modules for Annealage Mesh, and the shared file-response helper.

``microdot.Response.send_file`` and its own file-object and sync-generator
body handling both read the file synchronously on the event loop (see
``Response.body_iter`` in microdot's source: a file object is pumped with
blocking ``read()`` calls, not scheduled through an executor). A large STL
served that way stalls every other request, and later, every other in-flight
tool call and the token stream, since they all share this one loop. Every
route in this package that returns file bytes therefore builds its response
through ``file_response`` below instead of ``send_file``.

    The file is opened, and its size taken from that open descriptor via
    ``fstat``, before any header is constructed, so a file that vanishes or
    becomes unreadable between the caller's existence check and this call
    produces a 404 with no headers sent yet, rather than a committed 200
    whose promised ``Content-Length`` the body then fails to deliver.

    ``content_type`` is supplied by the caller (from ``paths.CONTENT_TYPES``)
    rather than guessed here, since the extension-to-type mapping is
    path-safety-adjacent policy that belongs with the rest of that logic.

    ``method`` distinguishes a HEAD request, which microdot's own
    ``Response.write`` never iterates or closes the body of (it sends
    headers only). For HEAD, the file is stat'd rather than opened, so no
    descriptor is left for garbage collection to eventually close; a caller
    that always opened the file regardless of method would leak one file
    descriptor per HEAD request until the interpreter got around to
    finalising the unread file object.

    ``revalidatable`` adds an ``ETag`` and ``Cache-Control: no-cache`` so a
    client can skip the transfer next time by asking. It is opt-in per route
    rather than the default, and only the packaged static assets set it. The
    tag is computed from the stat of the descriptor actually being read, so it
    describes exactly the bytes this response delivers rather than what a
    scan saw earlier. ``no-cache`` means "store it, but ask me before reusing
    it", which is what keeps a module edited during development from being
    served out of a browser cache while still saving the megabyte of vendored
    JavaScript on every reload. Model bytes deliberately do not set this: a
    model is the artefact under review and is regenerated constantly, so a
    stale one is the failure this tool exists to avoid.
