"""The ``/ws`` route: authentication, the greeting, replay, and frame dispatch.

A bug in this file is not a UI bug. ``/ws`` is the one route a browser tab
turns into a live bidirectional channel, and from the milestone that lands an
agent it carries turns into a Claude Code session with shell access in the
human's project. A check that can be bypassed here is a remote-code-execution
bug, so the three checks below are independent, each is commented with what it
defends against and why the other two do not cover it, and all three run
**before** the WebSocket handshake.

Refusing before the handshake, rather than upgrading and then closing with a
code, is deliberate and load-bearing in two ways. It means no connection
object, no queue and no writer task is ever created for a request that failed
authentication, so a refused caller cannot consume per-connection resources.
And it is the only form of refusal that microdot's in-process test client can
observe at all: that client's fake socket discards every outbound frame whose
opcode is not TEXT or BINARY, so a test asserting a close code through it
asserts on a frame the harness never delivered and cannot fail. An HTTP status
is checkable; a close code, on that path, is not.

Every refusal returns the same status and the same body. A response that
distinguished "no token" from "wrong token", or "bad Origin" from "bad Host",
would answer questions an unauthenticated caller should not be able to ask.

    A request supplying ``t`` more than once is refused outright rather than
