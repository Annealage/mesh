"""``POST /mcp``: the HTTP/authority side of the Codex tool-exposure bridge.

``planning/tickets/phase3_codex-tool-mcp-bridge.md`` (design), and
``planning/20260919_codex-mcp-bridge-finding.md`` (why there are two hops,
not one): Codex's app-server only ever launches an MCP server as a stdio
subprocess, never registers one over HTTP directly. So this route is not
reached by Codex itself - it is reached by mesh's own stdio-to-HTTP proxy
(``session/codex_mcp_stdio_bridge.py``), which Codex's app-server launches
as a subprocess per thread (``session/codex.py``'s ``config_overrides``) and
which speaks real MCP over stdio to Codex on one side and this route on the
other.

Because this endpoint's only legitimate caller is that proxy - a process
mesh itself launches and that never leaves this machine - it speaks a small,
internal, mesh-only JSON contract rather than the official MCP SDK's full
Streamable HTTP transport (session ids, SSE, resumability): that machinery
exists for a general-purpose MCP client reachable from anywhere, which this
is not. The protocol conformance that actually matters - the wire format
Codex's own real MCP client sees - is owned entirely by the proxy's stdio
side, built on the official ``mcp`` SDK's own ``Server``/``stdio_server``.
This route's request and response bodies are still built from
``mcp.types.Tool``/``CallToolResult`` (via ``model_dump(by_alias=True)``),
so the JSON shape matches the real MCP wire format field-for-field
(``inputSchema``, not ``input_schema``) and the proxy can parse it back with
the same types on its own side - the two ends cannot drift apart
independently, even though the transport between them is not itself
Streamable HTTP.

Request body: ``{"method": "tools/list"}`` or ``{"method": "tools/call",
"params": {"name": ..., "arguments": {...}}}``. Response body on success:
``{"result": {...}}``, the ``ListToolsResult``/``CallToolResult`` shape for
the method called. A malformed request is a plain ``{"ok": false, "error":
...}`` 400, matching every other JSON route in this package
(``read_json_body``).

Token- and Origin-gated exactly like ``/ws``/``/settings``
(``ws.py``'s ``_token_is_allowed``/``_origin_is_allowed``, reused rather than
reinvented): a tool-execution surface reachable from wherever the app-server
subprocess runs must never be unauthenticated, even bound to loopback only,
since the subprocess is not necessarily co-located with a human who already
passed the browser's own token check.

**Where the write-class approval gate lives, and why here.** Every write-class
mesh tool call must reach ``PermissionBroker`` exactly once
(``phase3_codex-tool-mcp-bridge.md``'s own acceptance criteria). For Claude,
that already happens entirely outside ``tools/registry.py``: the Claude Agent
SDK calls ``session/sdk.py``'s own ``can_use_tool`` for every tool not in
``allowed_tools`` (every write-class one), before the handler ever runs.
Codex's app-server has no equivalent hook for a generic external MCP tool
call - its own ``approval_handler`` fires only for its two native actions,
``item/commandExecution/requestApproval`` and
``item/fileChange/requestApproval`` (``session/codex.py``'s
``_APPROVAL_METHOD_TOOL``), never for ``tools/call`` on an MCP server it has
attached. Without a gate somewhere in this bridge, a write-class tool routed
through it would reach the broker zero times, not two - the failure mode
this route exists to close. ``tools/registry.py``'s own ``_wrap`` deliberately
does not call the broker (see its docstring), so this is not a second place
the READ/VIEW/WRITE classification gets decided: it is the one place this
particular transport connects the classification ``tool_table()`` already
carries (``ToolSpec.write``) to this particular driver's approval mechanism,
exactly as ``session/sdk.py`` does for its own.
