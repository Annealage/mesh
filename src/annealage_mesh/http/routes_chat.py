"""Route handlers for what the chat pane sends the server: an image, or a
request to write the conversation out.

Registers, against one served directory:

    POST /upload                  accepts one raw image (PNG, JPEG or WEBP)
                                   into images/, named by this process alone
    POST /session/<sid>/export    renders that session's event log into review/

The export route deliberately does not go through the permission broker, while
the ``export_transcript`` tool the model calls does. That asymmetry is the
point: a human pressing their own Export button has already decided, and a card
asking them to approve what they just clicked teaches them to click cards
without reading. The model asking for the same write has decided nothing on
the human's behalf, so it asks.

Refuses, in the order checked: an absent or wrong token, or ``t`` given more
than once (the same ``ws.refusal()`` response ``/ws`` returns, so an
unauthenticated caller cannot tell this route apart from any other); a
disallowed ``Origin``, checked here as well as on ``/ws`` because this is the
one route in the process that writes into the human's project and a POST
carrying a raw body is a CORS simple request, so no preflight stands in front
of it; an unknown query key, ``kind`` given twice, or ``kind`` outside its
whitelist; a missing or zero Content-Length; a Content-Length over
``paths.MAX_IMAGE_BYTES``; a body whose bytes are not a PNG, JPEG or WEBP;
and, once past every check above, whatever ``paths.create_unique_image_file``
itself refuses (an ``images/`` entry that cannot be written into, or every
generated name already taken), plus a write that fails partway or a body
shorter than its declared length.

Nothing is left on disk by a refusal, including one decided after the file
exists and including a caller that simply disappears: every exit past the
open goes through ``_abandon``.

The body is raw bytes, not multipart: microdot ships no multipart parser, and
the one thing a client chooses about an upload, its kind (``upload`` or
``sketch``), fits in a query parameter. The written file's name, including
its extension, never comes from the client; see
``paths.create_unique_image_file`` and ``paths.sniff_image``.
