"""Routes behind the settings window: what this run is using, what is saved,
and the diagnostics beside them.

Registers, against one served directory:

    GET  /settings   every setting's effective value and provenance, what is
                      saved on disk but not in effect, and the diagnostics block
    PUT  /settings   validate a batch of changes and write each to its own layer

Both require the token and a permitted ``Origin``, and refuse with the same
opaque response ``/ws`` returns, so neither tells an unauthenticated caller
which check it failed. ``PUT`` is privilege-relevant beyond the obvious: it can
change the bind address for the next run, so it validates and rejects rather
than merging what it is handed, and refuses outright to write a token or
``bypassPermissions`` (``settings.apply`` owns both refusals).

**Effective and saved are different questions, and this route answers both.**
For a restart-effect key, what is in effect is what this process resolved at
startup: reporting a freshly read file instead would claim a port the server is
not listening on. A settings window that showed only that could not confirm a
write it had just made, so anything now on disk that differs is reported under
``pending``, which is how the window says "9000 saved, this run is still on
8765" rather than silently discarding the write or lying about it. A file edited
by hand while the server runs surfaces the same way.

A load-effect key works the other way round, because each page applies it as it
loads: for a browser asking now, the value on disk is the one in effect, so
those keys report the fresh resolution and never appear in ``pending``.
Reporting the startup value for them would leave every later page applying a
preference the human had already changed.

Diagnostics duplicates ``annealage-mesh doctor`` on purpose: a remote user
looking at a phone has no terminal to run it in, which is exactly when knowing
whether the ``claude`` binary was found matters. Both read one collector, so
they cannot drift.
