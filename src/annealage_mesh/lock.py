"""``.mesh/lock``: refuses a second agent-mode instance in one project.

Two SDK clients resuming one session id, or two processes appending to one
``events.jsonl``, is corruption (plan section 3.4), so this module's only
job is to make a second concurrent agent-mode start impossible rather than
merely discouraged. Viewer-only runs never call ``acquire``: several
viewers on one project is the documented, supported case M4 already relies
on, and only one of them may ever also be driving an agent.

The file holds the holder's pid, port and per-run token as JSON, so a
refused second start can print the URL of the instance that is already
running instead of a bare refusal with no next step.
