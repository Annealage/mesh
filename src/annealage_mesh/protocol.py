"""Frame construction and validation for the ``/ws`` protocol.

``PROTOCOL_VERSION`` and every frame shape below are the contract in plan
section 3.3, implemented as written. ``http/ws.py`` (not this module)
owns the socket, the auth checks and the dispatch loop; this module only
knows how to build a well-formed frame and how to tell a well-formed
inbound one from a malformed one, with no I/O of its own.

Every frame, in either direction, carries ``{"v": PROTOCOL_VERSION,
"type": ...}``. Validation throughout is whitelist-shaped: a ``type`` this
module does not recognise, or a key beyond the ones a recognised type
allows, is refused rather than passed through or silently dropped,
matching the decision already made for ``PUT /settings``. A refusal
always carries a reason, because a frame refused with no explanation is a
debugging dead end for a phone user with no terminal.

Two shapes here are not in plan section 3.3's catalogue, and both are
flagged rather than buried since they are this module's own additions to
the contract.

``build_refused``: the plan's frame list has no shape for "the server
refused one inbound frame and the connection stays open"; the M4 brief
requires that reason reach the client regardless, and reusing the
existing browser-to-server ``error`` shape (which always carries a call
``id``) would make an uncorrelated protocol refusal look like a failed
reply to some particular ``call``. ``build_refused`` is a new, minimal
type for exactly that one purpose.

The inbound ``pause`` frame: the human's pause switch is enforced in the
server, because the tools it gates run there, so the browser's control has
to be able to say what the human chose. Neither addition changes
``PROTOCOL_VERSION``, and neither needs to: an older page never sends a
``pause`` frame and simply ignores an event kind or frame type it does not
recognise, which is the same tolerance every other addition to this
protocol relies on.

    ``WebSocket.close()`` takes no arguments and always sends an empty
    CLOSE payload (verified fact 1); the plan's close codes are not
    reachable through it. A coded close is built by hand instead:
    ``struct.pack("!H", code)`` for the two-byte code RFC 6455 puts first
    in a CLOSE frame's payload, followed by a UTF-8 reason. The reason is
    passed as bytes, not a str, because ``_encode_websocket_frame`` only
    calls ``.encode()`` for the TEXT opcode and passes bytes straight
    through for every other opcode including CLOSE; encoding here, once,
    is what makes that call correct. Truncated to 123 bytes, since a
    control frame's payload is capped at 125 bytes by RFC 6455 and two of
    those are already spent on the code.

    Guarded by ``ws.closed``, the same flag ``WebSocket.close()`` itself
    checks before sending: a second CLOSE frame after the first is a
    protocol violation, and this function and any later ``ws.close()``
    both consult the one flag, so whichever runs first is the only one
    that ever sends. This is the only place in this package that sends a
    coded close; per verified fact 2, ``http/ws.py`` calls
    ``websocket_upgrade`` directly rather than the ``with_websocket``
    decorator specifically so that decorator's own ``finally: await
    ws.close()`` can never append an empty CLOSE after this one.
