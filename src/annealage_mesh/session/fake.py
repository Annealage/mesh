"""FakeSession: a scripted stand-in for AgentSession, with no SDK involved.

This is the first of the plan's two fake layers (section 3.11). It exists
so ``viewers.py`` and ``http/ws.py`` have something to broadcast in every
test, in this milestone and in M5's, without paying for
``claude-agent-sdk``'s 93 MB extra or a real conversation. The second
layer, a fake ``Transport`` under the real SDK client, is what actually
catches an SDK protocol break; this class never claims to.

``FakeSession`` records what is submitted to it and emits events only
when a test tells it to, via ``emit``. It does not attempt to simulate an
agent replying to a turn on its own: a test that wants a canned reply
asserts on ``submitted_turns`` and then calls ``emit`` itself, which
keeps the scripting in the test rather than hidden inside a second,
undocumented turn-behaviour language living in this file.
