"""Whether the served directory's executable configuration may take effect.

A directory can carry configuration that the `claude` CLI obeys: `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, scripts under `.claude/hooks/`, and `.mcp.json`. Settings files may declare hooks, hooks are shell commands, and a `SessionStart` hook runs when the session opens, before any prompt is sent and before any permission callback exists to consult. A `.mcp.json` names server commands to spawn. So configuration in this directory is executable code, and the directory is not necessarily the human's own work: pointing Mesh at an unpacked download is an ordinary thing to do.

The CLI's own defence against this is its workspace trust dialog, and it states in `--print`'s help that the dialog "is skipped when Claude is run in non-interactive mode", which is the mode every SDK session runs in, adding: "Only use this in directories you trust." That makes the trust decision the embedding application's to make, and this module is Mesh's.

Two controls are built from what is here, and they answer different threats.

**The startup gate** (``cli.py``) refuses agent mode when this directory carries configuration whose current content the human has not accepted. It has to run before the session opens, because a `SessionStart` hook executing is precisely what it prevents, and nothing inside a running session is early enough.

**The in-session tripwire** (``session/sdk.py``) recomputes ``config_digest`` on every tool call and denies the call if it no longer matches what the gate accepted. It exists because the CLI re-reads these files while the session runs: a settings file written mid-session takes effect immediately, so a directory that was trustworthy at startup does not stay trustworthy by itself. The tripwire watches the files rather than the ways they might be written, so it is indifferent to whether a write arrived through Write, Edit, a shell redirect, or a `git checkout`.

Trust records live in the user's own configuration directory, never in the served directory, because a record stored alongside the thing it vouches for could be shipped inside the download it is meant to vouch for.

**Git's configuration is guarded too, and conditionally.** A repository's `.git/config` can name commands git runs (`core.fsmonitor`, `core.pager`, an alias beginning with `!`, a filter or textconv driver), and `.git/hooks/` holds scripts it runs directly. Both execute the moment the agent runs an ordinary git command, and git runs outside the sandbox by design, because it has to see the real filesystem to work on the project's own repository. Measured, so the scope is exact: `git rev-parse` and `git config user.email`, which are the commands Mesh itself runs against a directory it has not yet trusted, execute none of this, while `git status` and `git add`, which are the agent's, execute `core.fsmonitor`. So the exposure is the agent's git rather than Mesh's own scaffolding.

Unlike the four Claude paths, these two are guarded only when they carry something executable. Nearly every real project is a git repository, so gating on `.git/config` existing would ask about all of them and teach the human to accept without reading; gating on it naming a command asks about the ones that can act. An ordinary config from `git init` or `git clone` names none. The same conditional keeps the in-session tripwire quiet while the agent does ordinary git work: adding a remote does not change the digest, while adding an alias does.

What is deliberately not gated is `CLAUDE.md`. It is instructions rather than executable configuration, so a hostile one is a prompt-injection vector and not a code-execution one, and every tool call it might provoke still reaches the sandbox and the human. Gating it would prompt about nearly every real project and teach the human to accept without reading, which costs more than it buys.
