"""The stdio-to-HTTP proxy Codex launches per thread to reach mesh's tools.

``planning/tickets/phase3_codex-tool-mcp-bridge.md`` and
``planning/20260919_codex-mcp-bridge-finding.md``: Codex's app-server only
ever attaches an MCP server as a stdio subprocess, never registers one over
HTTP directly. ``session/codex.py``'s ``CodexSession.start()`` registers
*this* module (``python -m annealage_mesh.session.codex_mcp_stdio_bridge``,
via ``CodexConfig.config_overrides``) as that subprocess. It is a thin,
short-lived translation shim with no tool logic of its own - it does not
know what a callout is, what write-class means, or what the human sees; it
only forwards ``tools/list``/``tools/call`` to mesh's own ``/mcp`` endpoint
and hands back whatever comes back.

The stdio side is the one that actually has to be a fully conformant MCP
server, since Codex's real, unmodified client is on the other end of it and
this project does not control that side. So it is built entirely on the
official ``mcp`` SDK's own ``Server``/``stdio_server`` - the same officially
tested stdio-server path every other MCP stdio server uses, which handles
the ``initialize`` handshake, capability negotiation and JSON-RPC framing
without a line of protocol code here. The one thing that *is* this module's
own responsibility is what the registered ``list_tools``/``call_tool``
handlers do when the SDK calls them: an authenticated HTTP POST to mesh's
``/mcp`` (``http/routes_mcp.py``), which is a small internal JSON contract
between this process and that endpoint, not itself a second MCP transport -
see that module's docstring for why the two ends do not need to renegotiate
MCP a second time on the inner hop.

No search was found for an existing MIT/Apache-licensed, dependency-light
stdio-to-HTTP MCP proxy worth vendoring instead of this file: the ecosystem's
best-known example of the pattern, ``mcp-remote``, is an npm package with no
Python equivalent, and reaching for it would mean shipping a Node runtime
dependency mesh does not otherwise have, for a translation loop this file
implements in well under 100 lines using a dependency (``mcp``, ``httpx``)
this project already carries transitively through ``claude-agent-sdk`` (a
base dependency, not the optional ``codex`` extra) and now declares
directly.
