"""EventLog: monotonic seq, a bounded in-memory ring, and an optional
append-only ``events.jsonl``.

Every server-to-browser event carries a seq number that never repeats and
never goes backwards for a given log (plan section 3.4). A reconnecting
browser sends the last seq it saw; this module decides how much of what
happened since then can be replayed straight back over the socket versus
having to be paged from disk, and never silently drops the difference.

``EventLog`` takes an optional ``path``: with one it persists to
``events.jsonl`` beneath a session's own ``.mesh/sessions/<sid>/``
directory, and without one it is a pure in-memory ring, which is what lets
it be exercised directly against a ``tmp_path`` with no session, served
directory, or agent involved at all.

This is not the exchange-file threat model ``paths.py`` defends: those
files sit in a served project directory an outside party can also write
into, so every open there re-validates identity against a race. An
``events.jsonl`` lives inside this tool's own ``.mesh/`` control
directory, which nothing but this process ever writes to, so there is no
name to race and no symlink substitution to guard against; the file is
opened once, by name, and held for the log's lifetime.

``read_records``, ``render_transcript`` and ``export_transcript``, below,
turn one session's ``events.jsonl`` back into a document a person can read
or archive. They live here rather than in a separate module because a
transcript is a projection of exactly the file ``EventLog`` writes, and
reading it back is the direct counterpart to appending to it.
``export_transcript`` writes through ``paths.create_review_file``, which
gives a generated destination in a served project directory the same
containment ``paths.create_image_file`` gives a model-supplied one: the
directory is created by this process on first use, but the served project
directory around it is not otherwise trusted, so a ``review/`` replaced by
a symlink is refused rather than followed.

A rendered transcript never shows what a human typed. Nothing in
``session/base.py``'s ``AgentEvent`` set records the content of an inbound
turn: ``http/ws.py`` hands a turn frame's ``blocks`` straight to
``AgentSession.submit_turn`` without logging them anywhere first, so the
events this module reads back are exactly the ones a session produced on
its own. A transcript exported from here is a record of what the agent
said and did, not a transcript of the conversation the way a human would
read one back.

    still holds: some events between ``last_seq`` and the oldest one
    returned exist only in the append-only file (or, if no path was
    given, nowhere at all), and the caller must say so rather than
    replaying a partial history that looks complete. ``events`` is still
    populated in that case with whatever the ring does have, since
    telling the browser about a gap in its oldest history is no reason to
    also withhold the newer events that are available. ``truncated`` is
    also True when ``last_seq`` is below the log's own current position
    but the ring is empty (a restart recovers the seq counter but not the
    ring's contents), and when ``last_seq`` is higher than any seq this
    log has ever issued, which can only mean it belongs to a different
    run of the log than the one now being asked. In both cases real
