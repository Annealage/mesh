"""The real agent session for the local/arbitrary-endpoint backend: an
``omp_rpc.RpcClient`` behind the ``AgentSession`` seam.

**Where ``omp_rpc`` actually comes from.** It is not on PyPI under
``omp-rpc``/``omp_rpc`` (`pip install omp-rpc` and `uv pip install omp-rpc`
both fail with "not found in the package registry"; already checked and
documented in `planning/tickets/phase4_omp-session.md`'s revalidated stamp).
The package's real, MIT-licensed source lives in the upstream ``oh-my-pi``
monorepo at ``python/omp-rpc`` (github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi), which
``omp://rpc.md`` itself names as "the bundled `omp-rpc` distribution", and
installs cleanly as an ordinary wheel build via
``pip install "omp-rpc @ git+https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi.git@<sha>
#subdirectory=python/omp-rpc"`` (verified against commit
``71c5eec978b0e7ce9ff057eb4e311f67f4f03eb9``). This is deliberately *not*
declared as a `pyproject.toml` optional extra the way `codex` is: hatchling
refuses to build metadata for a direct (VCS) reference at all unless
``tool.hatch.metadata.allow-direct-references`` is set, and even with that
opt-in, PyPI's own upload validation rejects a package whose metadata
carries a direct URL dependency -- declaring one here would break this
project's real publish workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`), not
merely be inconvenient. Until `omp-rpc` publishes real PyPI releases (at
which point this becomes a normal `"omp-rpc>=X,<Y"` extra, mirroring
`codex`'s), a `backend = "local"` deployment installs it with the command
above as a manual, documented prerequisite. This module imports the real
package rather than re-implementing the wire protocol, because a maintained,
MIT-licensed client that already handles v2 chunk reassembly, message
pagination and host-tool/host-URI dispatch exists and is safe to embed; the
protocol doc (`omp://rpc.md`) remains the wire contract of record, not a
fallback this module has to also speak by hand.

**Concurrency model -- resolved by reading `omp_rpc/client.py` directly, not
assumed.** ``RpcClient`` is not asyncio-native. It is a synchronous,
thread-based client with the same shape ``openai_codex.client.CodexClient``
has (`session/codex.py`'s own module docstring): ``start()`` spawns a real
subprocess and a dedicated ``stdout`` reader thread (plus a separate
``stderr`` thread), and every registered event listener
(``on_message_update``, ``on_tool_execution_start``, ``on_ui_request``, ...)
is invoked *synchronously on that reader thread* as frames arrive. Every
``RpcClient`` method that sends a command and waits for its response
(``start``, ``stop``, ``prompt``, ``abort``, ``get_state``, ...) blocks the
calling thread. This session therefore owns one small ``ThreadPoolExecutor``
(``self._executor``) that every such one-shot blocking call runs on via
``self._run_blocking``, exactly mirroring `session/codex.py`'s
``_run_blocking``/``self._executor`` -- except this file needs no second
"drain" executor the way Codex's does. Codex's notification stream is scoped
per turn (a fresh subscription registered for each ``turn_start``, drained by
a dedicated background thread `session/codex.py` spawns itself); RPC's event
stream is one persistent subscription for the life of the process, delivered
by ``RpcClient``'s own reader thread with no polling required from this file
at all, which is structurally closer to `session/sdk.py`'s single long-lived
pump than to Codex's per-turn drain. Host-tool calls get an even better
guarantee the wire protocol doc does not mention: ``RpcClient`` spawns a
*fresh daemon thread per host-tool call* (`client.py`'s
``_handle_host_tool_call``), so blocking one tool's ``execute`` callback on a
human decision never blocks the shared reader thread or any other concurrent
tool call the way it would if execution ran inline.

**Permission design -- two independent, broker-backed gates, not one.** The
ticket's approach sketch flags ``extension_ui_request{method:"confirm"}`` as
the write-class approval surface; reading the actual bundled
``@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`` TypeScript source (this workstation's
installed `omp` build) shows the live per-tool approval gate
(``ExtensionToolWrapper``, wrapped around every registered tool, including
RPC host tools) actually resolves to a two-option ``extension_ui_request
{method:"select", options:["Approve","Deny"]}``, not ``confirm`` -- a detail
the wire-protocol doc does not surface and that could plausibly change
between builds either way. Relying on that exact shape (or reverse-engineering
a tool-name correlation out of free-text approval prompts) would make this
class only as correct as one build's private implementation. Instead:

1. This session launches `omp` with ``--auto-approve``, which neutralises
   `omp`'s own native approval gate entirely (confirmed via `omp --help`:
   "Auto-approve all tool calls (skip approval prompts)"), with
   ``--no-tools`` (``tools=()``), so the model's only capabilities are the
   host tools this session registers from `tool_table()`, and with
   ``--no-extensions`` (confirmed via `omp --help`: "Disable extension
   discovery (explicit -e paths still work)"). This last flag matters on
   its own: `omp` 18.1.22 unconditionally discovers ``.omp``/``.pi``
   extension files from ``cwd`` and loads them as trusted code with no
   trust prompt; without ``--no-extensions``, a project-local extension
   combined with ``--auto-approve`` could register its own native tools
   and execute at session start entirely outside this file's own
   ``host_tool_call`` broker gate -- the "real gate" claim below would be
   false the moment a session's ``cwd`` contained one. With extension
   discovery disabled, nothing but the host tools registered below can
   ever run. The *real* gate is therefore inside this file's own
   ``host_tool_call`` adapter: a write-class tool's ``execute`` callback
   calls ``broker.ask(...)`` itself, exactly the role
   `session/codex.py`'s ``_approval_handler`` and `session/sdk.py`'s
   ``_can_use_tool`` play for their own backends, before ever running the
   real handler. This is unaffected by whichever UI-request shape a given
   `omp` build happens to use for its own native gate, because that gate
   never fires.
2. `extension_ui_request{method:"confirm"}` is still handled, exactly as
   the ticket specifies, as a defensive second layer: `omp` may still
   raise a confirm for something unrelated to tool execution (a login
   flow, a provider-tier notice), and a host must answer every request it
   receives or risk stalling the run. When one arrives, this session
   looks up which tool call is currently in flight (tracked from
   ``tool_execution_start``/``tool_execution_end``, in order on the same
   reader thread that delivers the confirm, so there is no race between
   "note which tool started" and "a confirm arrives for it") and asks the
   broker on that tool's behalf, *before* answering -- but only when
   exactly one tool call is in flight. `omp`'s default parallel-tool-
   execution mode runs sibling tool calls from the same assistant turn
   concurrently (``RpcClient`` spawns a fresh daemon thread per host-tool
   call precisely because more than one may be running at once -- see
   this module's concurrency-model note above), so a ``confirm`` frame
   carries no tool-call id on the wire and cannot be safely attributed to
   "whichever tool call is currently in flight" once two or more are
   pending: the wrong tool's ``execute`` callback could silently receive
   another tool's allow/deny decision. When zero or more than one tool
   call is in flight, this session declines the confirm outright rather
   than guess. ``PermissionBroker.ask()`` already checks its own
   granted-tools set and shuts the door on a no-viewer session before it
   ever creates a request or emits anything a human would see (see
   `permissions.py`'s ``ask()`` docstring) -- this session never
   duplicates that check itself, it just always calls into the one
   function that owns it, for both gates. A confirm this session cannot
   attribute to exactly one in-flight tool is declined outright, never
   approved blind.

**Custom-provider injection -- resolved by reading `omp`'s own settings and
provider docs, not assumed.** ``RpcClient`` has no ``base_url``/``api_key``
constructor knobs of its own; a custom OpenAI-compatible provider is
`omp`-level config (`omp://providers.md`'s "Custom providers in
`models.yml`"), loaded only from ``<agent dir>/models.yml``/``.yaml``
(`omp://models.md`'s "Config file location") -- there is no `--config`
overlay path or per-project file for it. ``PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`` relocates
that entire agent directory (auth store, sessions, cache, and the model
config alongside it), so this session gives every launch its own throwaway
temp directory via that env var, writes a ``models.yml`` there, and tears
the directory down in ``close()``. This keeps the human's own `omp` install
(auth, other providers, saved sessions) completely untouched by a
mesh-launched local-backend run. The file is written as ``json.dumps(...)``
rather than through a YAML library: JSON is valid YAML, `omp`'s config
loader accepts a `.yml` path with JSON content without complaint, and this
avoids adding a YAML dependency for a one-off machine-generated file no
human ever hand-edits.

``local_api_key``, when set, is never written into ``models.yml`` as a
literal string: `omp`'s own ``apiKey`` resolution (`omp://providers.md`)
treats that field as an environment-variable name first and a leading
``!`` as a shell command to run, so a literal secret that happens to
collide with a real env var name would be silently replaced by that
variable's value, and one that happens to start with ``!`` would be
executed. This session instead generates a per-session environment
variable name (``_api_key_env_name``), sets it on the launched
subprocess's own environment (never the human's), and writes that name
into ``apiKey`` -- using `omp`'s primary resolution path deliberately,
not fighting it.

class OmpSession:
    """An ``AgentSession`` driving a real ``omp_rpc.RpcClient``.

    ``on_event`` is called with every ``AgentEvent`` this session produces,

    either.

    ``client_factory`` is this class's injection seam for tests, the same

    taken once at construction the same way ``SdkSession`` is handed
    ``bus.mesh_tools.mcp_servers`` once: every tool this session ever
    exposes to `omp` comes from this snapshot, registered as `omp` host
    tools rather than through a second transport (unlike Codex, which needs
    its own stdio-to-HTTP MCP bridge -- see this file's module docstring).
