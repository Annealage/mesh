"""The real agent session for the Codex backend: a low-level ``CodexClient``
behind the ``AgentSession`` seam.

**Why this file drives ``openai_codex.client.CodexClient`` directly, never
``Codex``/``AsyncCodex``/``AsyncCodexClient``.** Read
``planning/20260919_codex-approval-handler-finding.md`` for the full source
trail; the short version is that the public wrapper classes have no
constructor parameter for ``approval_handler`` at all, and silently
auto-accept every ``item/commandExecution/requestApproval`` request via
``CodexClient._default_approval_handler`` when none is given. For a project
whose whole approval-broker design exists to put a human between the model
and a destructive command, that is not a partial gap, it is a total bypass.
Constructing ``CodexClient`` directly and always passing ``approval_handler``
is the only way to keep a Codex-backed session honest.

**Why every call into the client crosses a thread bridge, not only the
approval callback.** ``CodexClient``'s own docstring: "Synchronous typed
JSON-RPC client for `codex app-server` over stdio." There is no working
async variant that also supports ``approval_handler``. This class therefore
owns a dedicated single-worker ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` (``self._executor``)
that every one-shot blocking call (``start``, ``initialize``,
``account_read``, ``thread_start``/``thread_resume``, ``turn_start``,
``turn_interrupt``, ``close``, the login calls) runs on via
``self._run_blocking``, the one helper this file uses instead of repeating
``loop.run_in_executor`` at each call site.

**Why turn-notification draining gets its OWN executor, not the one above.**
This is a correction to the ticket's original approach sketch, found by
reading ``client.py``'s ``_message_router.py`` internals rather than
assuming: ``CodexClient`` is explicitly designed for concurrent access from
multiple threads (each JSON-RPC request gets its own response queue, each
turn gets its own notification queue, and only a lock around writing to the
child's stdin is shared), specifically so that a caller waiting on
``next_turn_notification`` for a long-running turn does not block a
*different* caller wanting to send ``turn/interrupt`` at the same time.
Putting the notification-drain loop (which blocks for the whole duration of
a turn, including however long a pending approval takes) on the SAME
single-worker executor as ``turn_interrupt`` would queue every interrupt
request behind the very turn it is meant to cut short, and it would never
run until the turn ended on its own -- silently defeating ``interrupt()``.
``self._drain_executor`` is therefore a second, separate single-worker pool
used for nothing but draining one turn's notifications at a time.

**Where the approval callback actually runs.** ``client.py``'s single
reader thread (``_reader_loop``) reads one JSON-RPC message at a time; when
that message is a server request (an approval), it calls
``self._approval_handler`` synchronously and cannot read the next message
until that call returns. So the approval bridge below
(``_approval_handler``, ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(broker.ask(...),
loop).result()``) blocks *that* thread, a third one distinct from both
``self._executor`` and ``self._drain_executor`` -- CodexClient's own
internal reader thread, spawned inside ``client.start()``. Blocking it is
correct and intentional (it is exactly ``can_use_tool``'s "the turn is
paused until answered" semantics, mirrored from ``session/sdk.py``), not a
bug to route around.

Everything else about this file's shape mirrors ``session/sdk.py``
deliberately: the same ``_set_status``/``AGENT_CONNECTING``/``AGENT_READY``/
``AGENT_UNAVAILABLE`` transitions, the same ``_emit`` helper, the same
viewer-presence counting feeding ``PermissionBroker``, and the same "a
session owns its turn and keeps producing events regardless of whether a
browser is attached" pump discipline -- except the pump here is a background
OS thread per turn (``_drain_turn``), because ``next_turn_notification`` is
blocking, not an async generator the event loop can iterate directly.

        reading it directly rather than assumed -
        ``planning/20260919_codex-mcp-bridge-finding.md``); Codex parses

        ``_toml_string`` (``session/permissions.py``'s own escaper for
        exactly this purpose elsewhere in this project, reused rather than
        duplicated: the escaping a value needs to be a safe TOML string is
        the same whichever file the string ends up written into). The
        launched proxy is always ``sys.executable -m
        annealage_mesh.session.codex_mcp_stdio_bridge`` - the same
        interpreter and installed package running this process, guaranteed
        to have that module and its own dependencies (``mcp``, ``httpx``)
        importable regardless of whether the optional ``codex`` extra is
        installed, since both are already transitive dependencies of
        ``claude-agent-sdk``, a base dependency, and are now declared
        directly.

        Whether ``config_overrides`` accepts a table-shaped value the same
        way TOML would, or only flat scalar ``key=value`` pairs, was not
        verified against a live ``codex app-server`` process - this ticket's
        own stated Open Question. This follows the literal example in that
        finding note as the most standards-conformant TOML-literal encoding
        available without a live process to check against: a bare
        ``command="..."`` scalar assignment, and ``args=[...]`` as a TOML
        array-of-strings literal assigned the same dotted-path way. It is a
        follow-up item for the manual integration pass
