"""Turning an ``image_path`` block into something the model can see.

An ``image_path`` block (``{"type": "image_path", "path": "images/<name>"}``)
is this project's own invention, checked by ``protocol.py``'s
``_BLOCK_SPECS`` on the way in but meaningless to the CLI, which speaks only
the Anthropic content-block shapes. ``expand_turn_blocks`` is what turns
such a block into something the model can actually see: an inline base64
``image`` block, standing next to a ``text`` block naming the same
``images/<name>`` string, so the model can later hand that path to its own
tools. One without the other is half of fact 6's dual delivery, not a
smaller version of it: pixels with no path leave the model unable to name
what it saw, and a path with no pixels is not an attachment at all.

Ordering is not a preference. Fact 6 requires every image block to precede
whatever text refers to it; the observed failure when that is violated is
the model ignoring the attached image outright and going hunting the
filesystem for a file matching words in the trailing text instead of
looking at what it was handed. ``expand_turn_blocks`` therefore reorders
unconditionally: every block this expansion produces for an ``image_path``
(an accepted pair, or a rejection note standing in for one) is placed before
every ``text`` block the caller supplied, regardless of how the two were
interleaved on the wire.

The entry point is ``expand_turn_blocks``. It is a pure function over a block
list and a directory, which is why it lives here rather than in ``sdk.py``:
that module owns the client, the options and the message pump, and none of the
reasoning below is about any of the three.

    ``paths.resolve_asset`` is the second and only filesystem-aware
    containment check: it refuses a name that resolves outside
    ``serve_dir``/images (including through a symlink), a symlinked
    ``images/`` itself, and anything that is not a regular file, returning the
    resolved path and the identity it validated. That identity is reasserted
    against the freshly opened descriptor below, the same re-check
    ``paths.read_fixed_file`` performs for the same reason: resolution and
    open are separate operations, and a served directory's ``images/`` is not
    a tree only this process writes to, so the name can be relinked in
    between.

    The size cap is ``paths.MAX_INLINE_IMAGE_BYTES``, what may be inlined,
    which is well below what ``/upload`` will store: a photograph a human
    attached is kept at full resolution as evidence, and a file above the
    inline cap is refused as a picture while still being named to the model as
    a path it can read. The check runs before the bytes are read, not after,
    because a file placed under ``images/`` by hand rather than through
    ``/upload`` is bounded by nothing else, and reading an oversized file just
    to reject it would spend the memory and IO this check exists to avoid.

    The media type is decided by ``paths.sniff_image`` against these bytes,
    never against ``path``'s own suffix: that suffix was chosen by this
    project from a file's bytes for anything ``/upload`` wrote, or was not
    chosen by anyone for a file a human dropped into ``images/`` directly,
    and either way it is the weaker source of the two.
