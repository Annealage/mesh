/**
 * The one module that POSTs `/upload`. It is the only reader of `ws.js`'s
 * `authToken()` outside `ws.js` itself, and the only writer of
 * `state.chat.attachments`, so an attachment always reaches the store through
 * this one path regardless of which UI started it: the composer's file picker,
 * paste and drop handlers in `chat.js`, or a composite the sketch overlay
 * builds. Neither of those callers writes `state.chat.attachments` itself;
 * they call `uploadImage` and read what it returns.
 *
 * The slot is reserved before the request goes out, which is what makes the
 * attachment cap a refusal rather than an apology: a file offered when the
 * message is already full is turned away before a byte leaves the page, so
 * nothing is written into the human's project that no message will reference.
 * It is also what keeps the strip in the order things were attached, since the
 * position is taken at attach time rather than whenever the network answers.
 *
 * An upload that fails leaves its slot behind, in the 'error' state, for the
 * human to see and dismiss. An upload that succeeds leaves a file in the
 * served project whether or not the message that prompted it is ever sent:
 * nothing here deletes it, because `images/` is git-tracked evidence of what a
 * part looked like at some moment and silently removing a file the server
 * already wrote would be the surprising half of that bargain.
