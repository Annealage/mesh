"""What ``annealage-mesh doctor`` prints and what ``GET /settings`` returns
under its own ``diagnostics`` key: one collector, read by both, because the
settings window's Diagnostics block exists to duplicate the terminal
command for a person with no terminal, and a second function computing the
same facts a second way would give the two a chance to disagree.

``collect`` never raises. Every fact it gathers comes from a lookup that is
routinely absent or broken on someone else's machine: no ``git`` on PATH, a
platform whose ``claude-agent-sdk`` wheel carries no bundled binary and
whose PATH has no ``claude`` either, a ``.mesh/lock`` left behind by a crash
mid write. A doctor command that raises on the question "what is wrong with
this machine" has failed at its only job, so each such lookup becomes a
value describing what happened (``None``, a ``"source": "missing"``, a
version string that says a subprocess would not run) rather than an
exception a caller has to catch.

``claude_cli`` distinguishes a bundled binary from one found on PATH rather
than reporting a bare path, because which of the two is in play is a real
platform difference: most wheels bundle ``claude`` under
``claude_agent_sdk/_bundled``, but a platform with no published wheel falls
back to the SDK's dependency-free sdist, which bundles nothing, so
``claude`` then has to be installed and reachable on PATH like any other
tool. A human debugging "the agent will not start" needs to know which of
those two is true before anything else.

The bundled binary is located with ``importlib.util.find_spec`` rather than
``import claude_agent_sdk``: locating a package's install directory this
way runs no code in it. The ``sandbox`` field cannot avoid the real import,
because ``session.sdk`` is where ``SANDBOX_DEPENDENCIES`` and
``missing_sandbox_dependencies`` live and that module's own top-level
``from claude_agent_sdk import (...)`` pulls in the SDK as a side effect of
merely importing it, so the import is written inside ``collect`` rather
than at this module's top level. That import still happens every time
``collect`` actually runs; what it does not do is happen merely because
something imported this module, which matters for a viewer-only doctor
invocation and is what lets a test of that property import this module with
no SDK installed at all.

The lock record is read without ever calling ``lock.acquire``: acquiring an
unheld lock creates one, and a diagnostics report must never have that side
effect. What is read is also deliberately incomplete. ``.mesh/lock`` holds
the live per-run token guarding this project's agent-mode instance, and that
token is discarded rather than surfaced here, whether it names this
process's own run or, if a different pid holds the lock, someone else's: a
diagnostics report is not a channel for handing back a still-valid
credential.

Two lookups reach past ``net.py``'s and ``lock.py``'s public surface into a
private helper each: ``net._reachable_addresses`` for the addresses this
machine answers on, and ``lock._read_record`` plus ``lock._pid_is_live`` for
a read-only look at the lock. Both modules already compute exactly this
correctly, the second with a liveness rule (an ``EPERM`` on ``os.kill``
counts as alive) that is easy to get subtly wrong a second time, and neither
currently exposes a public, side-effect-free way to ask the question this
module needs answered. Reimplementing either would be the second copy of a
fact one function already gets right.

    its own resolved bind and current session as plain values, and asking
    this function to interpret them would make it a second place deciding
    what a bind or a session id means. A standalone ``doctor`` invocation
    with no running server passes none of the three, and the fields are
    ``None``.

    ``backend`` gates the ``codex_cli`` and ``omp_cli`` facts: each is
    present only for its own backend, so a ``claude``-backend run (or a
    standalone ``doctor`` invocation that never resolved a backend at all)
