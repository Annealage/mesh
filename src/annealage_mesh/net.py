"""Bind-mode resolution, the per-run token, the Origin allowlist and the
startup banner.

These four things belong together and belong away from both routing and
argument parsing, because they are one decision with one output: what this
process is reachable on, and therefore what it should accept. The Origin
allowlist is computed from the resolved bind rather than hardcoded to
localhost, so remote access works at all; the banner reports the same
resolved bind back to the human, so exposure is never something they have to
infer. Putting this in ``cli.py`` would make it untestable without argparse,
and putting it in ``app.py`` would mix it with request handling.

``resolve_bind`` takes its two collaborators, ``run`` and ``which``, as
parameters so a test can supply canned command output instead of depending on
whether a real ``tailscale`` or ``ip`` binary happens to be installed on the
machine running the suite.
