"""Builds the microdot application for any product and owns its asyncio
startup and shutdown.

``create_app`` wires the agent layer's routes (``/ws``, the chat, settings and
``/mcp`` routes, and ``/agent/static/`` for its own front end) and whatever
routes the product registers onto a fresh ``Microdot`` instance, together with
the pieces every product shares: the Host check, the event log, the viewer
registry and bus, the product's tool server, the session, and the security
headers every response carries. A fresh instance per call means independent
served directories never share route state, which matters for tests.
``serve`` binds the socket, hands control back
to the caller once it is actually listening, then serves until interrupted and
closes the listener before returning.

The product's own application module (Mesh: ``annealage_mesh/app.py``) calls
both, adding its routes and the background tasks that watch its files.

# only /submit and /upload, and every other microdot app or test sharing
# this interpreter. 8 MiB comfortably covers a full-page pin review
# (microdot's 16 KiB default caps a submission at roughly 68 pins of the
# {id, part, label, point, normal, faceIndex, comment} shape the viewer
# sends): a 400-pin submission measures about 84 KB, so 8 MiB is far more
# headroom than the real payload needs, and it matches files.MAX_IMAGE_BYTES,
# the separate cap /upload enforces on itself. The actual exposure of that
# headroom is per in-flight request, not aggregate: microdot imposes no cap
# on concurrent connections and no read timeout, so N slow or stalled
# clients each declaring a large Content-Length can together hold open N
# times this many bytes' worth of allowance for as long as they keep their
# sockets open. That aggregate exposure is unbounded; capping it needs a
# connection limit or a read timeout, and this module has neither.
#
# configure_request_limits sets max_body_length to 0, microdot's documented
# "always access the body as a stream" value: no route is ever handed a
# buffered req.body. Every route that reads a body (/submit, /upload)
# checks Content-Length itself first, refusing a missing or zero value,
# then reads exactly that many bytes off req.stream in bounded chunks. A
# route that read the stream without that check would, on a real
# connection with no declared length, read forever: req.stream is then the
# raw client reader, and nothing ever makes such a read return.

    ``page_html`` is the path of the product's page, whose inline scripts the
    Content-Security-Policy hashes. ``register_routes(app, allowed_origins)``
    registers the product's own routes, and is called before the agent
    layer's. The product's tool server comes from the installed product's
    ``build_tools`` (``product.py``), called here once in agent mode; an
    agent-mode app for a product with no tool builder is refused here, at
    startup, rather than failing on the first tool call.

    ``login`` is the run's ``LoginNonces`` (``http/routes_login.py``), from
    which the CLI issues the nonce in the URL it opens a browser on; ``None``
    gives the app a fresh one of its own.

    ``host`` is an address already resolved (``net.resolve_bind`` does the
    resolving, in the product's CLI), and together with ``port`` and
    ``extra_origins`` it decides the exact ``Origin`` and ``Host`` values this
    app accepts. Computing those here, from the bind, is what lets a remote
    viewer work at all: an allowlist hardcoded to localhost would refuse
    every tailnet client.

    ``token`` is the browser token: the only credential ``/ws``, the chat
    routes, ``/settings`` and every product route that asks for one accept.
    ``None`` means no token was configured, and ``/ws`` then refuses every
    request. ``agent_token`` is the separate per-run agent token, the only
    credential ``/mcp`` accepts; ``None`` means ``/mcp`` refuses every
    request. The two are kept apart because the agent token is handed to a
    process beside the agent's own shell (the Codex stdio bridge) and the
    browser token authorises permission decisions, so a run whose two tokens
    are equal is refused here rather than built.

    ``session_id`` is the id the CLI resolved for this run (fresh or resumed,
    per plan section 3.4), or None for viewer-only; it is reported in the
    ``hello`` frame's ``session`` object and names the conversation the tool
    server writes out.

    ``settings`` is the ``settings.Resolved`` this run started with, which
    the CLI builds because only it knows which flags were given. Passing
    ``None`` resolves the file and default layers here instead, so a caller
    with no flags to declare, which is every test, needs to know nothing about
    settings at all.

    ``session_info``, when given, is the same mutable dict ``register_ws``'s
    ``_greet`` reads fresh on every ``hello`` (``http/ws.py``): an
    ``AgentModelChanged`` here means a live ``set_model`` actually took
    effect, so ``session_info["model"]`` is updated in place before the event
    reaches the log. Without this, a browser tab connecting after the switch
    only recovers the running model while the event that announced it is
    still inside the replay ring buffer; once evicted, a fresh ``hello``
    would otherwise fall back to permanently showing the CLI-configured
    starting model instead of what the session is actually running.

    """Serve ``app`` on ``host``:``port`` until interrupted.

    Binds with ``start_serving=False`` and then explicitly awaits
    ``Server.start_serving()`` before calling ``on_ready``: binding alone
    only creates the socket, the kernel does not call ``listen()`` on it
    until serving actually starts, so a caller connecting between bind and
    that call would see a refused connection. ``on_ready`` therefore
    describes a socket that is already accepting connections, not one that
    merely will be. ``on_ready`` may be a plain function or a coroutine
    function; if calling it returns an awaitable, that awaitable is awaited
    before this function proceeds, which lets a caller offload blocking
    work (such as opening a browser) onto the event loop's executor instead
    of running it inline on the loop that is meant to already be serving.

    ``background`` is the product's own long-running coroutine functions
    (Mesh: its file watchers' ``run``), each called and started as a task once
    the session has started, and cancelled on the way out. Functions rather
    than coroutines, so nothing is created that a failed bind would leave
    never awaited.

    ``start_serving()`` alone is enough to keep the server accepting
    connections; nothing further needs to run for that to continue, so this
    then simply blocks until the caller cancels the task (``KeyboardInterrupt``
    in the CLI). ``asyncio.Server.serve_forever()`` is deliberately not used
    for that block: its own ``CancelledError`` handler runs an *unbounded*
    ``close()`` plus ``wait_closed()`` internally before re-raising, which
    would defeat ``SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`` below by blocking on any
    still-open connection before this function's own bounded wait ever gets
    a chance to run. Shutdown, on ``KeyboardInterrupt`` or task cancellation,
    stops accepting new connections and waits up to
    ``SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`` for in-flight requests to finish; past that
    bound it returns anyway, since microdot has no way to cut an in-flight
    request off short of dropping the connection.
