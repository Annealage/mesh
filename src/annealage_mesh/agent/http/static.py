"""Serving files through a cached, scanned index: the agent layer's own front
end, a product's page and modules, and anything else a product indexes.

Registers, on every app the agent layer builds:

    GET  /agent/static/<path:rel>   the agent layer's own front end (the chat
                                    pane, settings window, socket client and
                                    the store they share), from ``agent/static/``

``/agent/static/`` is a prefix of its own, outside a product's ``/static/``,
so the two trees can never answer for each other: each is a separate
``files.StaticIndex`` with its own cache, and neither route can resolve a
name the other's scan found. A product's page imports these modules through
its import map (Mesh maps the bare prefix ``agent/`` to this route), which is
what lets the prefix move without a product module changing.

The rest of this module is the machinery every indexed route shares, whether
it serves a packaged asset or a product's own index of a served directory
(Mesh's models): ``make_index_cache`` scans off the event loop and reuses the
result for a short window, and ``serve_indexed`` resolves one file through it,
rescanning once when the file on disk is not the one the scan validated.

    ``build`` is ``files.build_static_index`` or a product's own index builder
    (Mesh: ``paths.build_model_index``), called with ``target`` (a static tree
    or a served directory) off the event loop, its result reused for up to
    ``INDEX_CACHE_TTL`` seconds. This is the one caching implementation every
    indexed route goes through, each with its own call to this factory rather
    than a second copy of the logic, since the shape (scan off-loop, cache
    with a TTL, share one in-flight scan, allow an explicit invalidate) is
    identical whatever is scanned. A separate call is a separate cache, which
    is what keeps two trees from ever answering for each other.

    Only one scan is ever in flight at a time. A cache miss stores the
    scan's ``Task`` before awaiting it, so every request that arrives while
    that scan is still running awaits the same task instead of launching its
    own; without this, a page load's simultaneous requests would each pay for
    a full scan during every cold window, and a burst of concurrent requests
    during one cold window would each launch a separate walk, all competing
    for the same default executor that file reads and writes also depend on.
