"""Assembly of a product's tool server, and the two policies every tool obeys.

A product supplies its tools as ``claude_agent_sdk`` ``@tool`` definitions
(its ``Product.build_tools``) together with a ``Grading`` that sorts every one
of them into three grades by **what a mistake would cost**. This module turns
the two into one in-process MCP server, ``ToolServer``, and owns everything
about that server that is not the product's own: the refusal to build a set
whose grading does not match it, the pause gate, the mapping of viewer
failures to messages a model can act on, the pre-allowed name list every
backend receives, and the transport-neutral ``tool_table`` the non-Claude
backends build their own servers from.

``read`` changes nothing. Reading the camera, a part list, the comments or a
screenshot leaves the project and the view exactly as they were, so these are
pre-allowed and never interrupt anyone.

``view`` changes only what is on the screen, and does so in front of the
human, who is looking at that screen. These are pre-allowed too. The
reasoning is not that they are harmless in the abstract, it is that an
approval card is the wrong control for them: the loop a product's tools exist
for has the model reframing something it has just changed, several times a
turn, and a card per camera move would either be clicked without reading or
turned off with one standing grant, which is worse than not asking. The
control that fits is the pause switch, which refuses all of them at once for
as long as the human wants the view to hold still, and that is what it is
for.

``write`` leaves something behind after the page is closed: a callout in a
file the human's own tooling reads, an image in the project directory, or a
transcript that carries whatever was said about the hardware under review.
These are deliberately **absent** from every allow list, which is what makes
them reach the broker and therefore the human as a card. Adding one of these
names to a pre-allowed list anywhere would silently remove that card.

So two derived sets follow, and they are not the same set:
``Grading.pre_allowed`` is read plus view, and ``Grading.pause_gated`` is view
plus write. The product's grading is the only place any of this is written
down, and ``_verify`` refuses to build a server whose tools do not match it
exactly, so a tool added to a product without being graded fails at startup
rather than defaulting into a posture nobody chose.

Every handler returns one of ``ok`` or ``fail`` and nothing else. A tool
result reaches the model as text, so what a handler returns is prose it will
read: ``ok`` renders a payload as indented JSON, because coordinates and part
names are what these tools are for and JSON is the shape a model reads them
out of most reliably, and ``fail`` returns a sentence saying what went wrong
and what to do instead. That second half matters more than it looks: a deny's
message reaches the model verbatim (plan section 2a, fact 15), so "no viewer
connected; ask the human to open <url>" is worth more than a status code.

Importing this module imports ``claude_agent_sdk``, so only agent-mode code
paths import it; a viewer-only run never does.
