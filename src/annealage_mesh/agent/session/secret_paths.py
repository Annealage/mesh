"""Refusing tool calls that reach for the credentials on this machine.

The sandbox this project runs the agent's shell in restricts writes and network
but not reads (plan section 2, fact 19), so without something else a contained
command can read anything its user can: SSH private keys, cloud access keys, the
GPG secret keyring, the token this very agent authenticates with. That matters
more here than in a general-purpose agent, because this tool reads STL comments
and filenames, which are untrusted input, while holding a shell.

This module is that something else. It decides, for one tool call, whether the
call names a path that must not be read or written, and the decision is enforced
by a ``PreToolUse`` hook, which fact 25 verified is upstream of both a settings
file's allow rules and the sandbox's own auto-approval. A settings ``deny`` rule
would be the other candidate and is weaker: it is invisible to this process, and
a settings file in the served directory can shadow it.

**What this does and does not claim.** For a tool that names a file in an
argument, the check is exact: the path is expanded and resolved, so a symlink
planted inside the project that points at ``~/.ssh`` is refused along with the
direct spelling. For ``Bash`` it is textual and therefore partial: a command
that spells the path in a variable, builds it from a glob, or decodes it from
base64 is not caught. That is worth having anyway, because bash is the agent's
default path and the common cases are the direct ones, but it raises a floor
rather than drawing a boundary. Anyone reasoning about a determined agent should
assume the shell can still read these files.

The list is deliberately short: every entry is somewhere whose theft cannot be
undone by changing a password, and nothing on it is a place legitimate work in a
CAD project ever reaches. A list broad enough to cover, say, all of
``~/.config`` would also refuse things the agent has real reasons to read, and a
control that fires on ordinary work teaches people to turn it off.
