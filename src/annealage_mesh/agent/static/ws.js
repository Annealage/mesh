/**
 * Browser side of the /ws transport: reads the per-run token out of the URL
 * once, connects, exchanges hello and replay, dispatches server events, and
 * drives the topbar connection indicator. Reconnection uses capped
 * exponential backoff and never stops on its own except for the two cases
 * that retrying cannot fix within this page load: a protocol-version
 * mismatch, and a confirmed token refusal.
 *
 * This module is the only place the token is held; it lives in the
 * TOKEN module variable, never in localStorage or sessionStorage, because a
 * token that outlives the run it belongs to is a liability and a fresh one
 * is generated every server start anyway.
 *
 * This module never writes the product's state and knows nothing about what
 * the product shows. What the product needs from the socket it hands in to
 * `initWs` (main.js is where the two meet):
 *
 * - `onEvent`, `{kind: fn(event)}`, handles the product's own event kinds
 *   (the ones the product registered server-side, e.g. Mesh's
 *   `callouts_changed`). A kind listed there goes to its handler and nowhere
 *   else; the server already refuses a product kind that collides with a
 *   generic one, so this map can only ever take kinds the chat pane has no
 *   use for.
 * - `onLive` runs on every successful handshake, the first and every
 *   reconnect, after the connection is marked live: the product stops its
 *   fallback poll there and refetches whatever an event it missed while the
 *   socket was down would have told it, since replay only covers events
 *   still in the server's ring.
 * - `onFallback` runs when the socket stops being the live channel for a
 *   while (a downtime longer than one backoff interval, a protocol mismatch,
 *   a confirmed refusal): the product starts whatever poll keeps its view
 *   current without the socket. ws.js owns the decision of when; the product
 *   owns the poll's mechanics, so the push and the poll never both run.
 * - `connTitles` overrides the indicator's tooltips by state, for a product
 *   whose live channel means something more specific than "updates".
 *
 * `onHello` and `onAgentEvent` are the chat pane's two inbound hooks:
 * `onHello` receives the hello frame's `session` object once per connection
 * (including every reconnect, since agent status can change between them),
 * and `onAgentEvent` receives every event neither this module nor a product
 * handler takes. Neither is called from here except at those two points;
 * chat.js, not this module, decides what an event means. The returned `send`
 * is this module's only outbound capability, so a turn, permission, pause or
 * interrupt frame still goes out over the one socket this closure owns, with
 * no second connection or second reconnect policy.
 *
 * `dispatchCall` is the product's method table, and it is what makes a `call`
 * frame do something: this module owns the correlation (answer the id, exactly
 * once, whatever happened) and knows nothing about what any method means.
 * `onPaused` receives the pause flag from both places it can arrive, the hello
 * frame and a `pause_changed` event, so its caller has one path to reconcile
 * rather than two.
