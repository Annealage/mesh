 * The pause control: the human's switch for the agent's control of this

 *
 * What it pauses is the product's view-grade tools (the server's pause gate,
 * `agent/tools.py`), the ones that act on what the human is looking at; the
 * agent's own file edits and commands are not affected, and it can still read
 * the view. The button's wording is the page's own, since only the product
 * knows what its view-grade tools do.
 *
 * It is a pure reader of `store.paused`: clicking sends a frame and nothing
 * else, and the label only changes when the server says the flag moved. A
 * control that latched locally would show "paused" while the tools it claims
 * to gate were still running.
