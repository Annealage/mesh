"""The on-disk shape of ``.mesh/sessions/`` and ``.mesh/state.json``, and the
lookups ``-c``/``-r`` (plan section 3.4) resolve a session id through.

One Mesh session is one directory, ``.mesh/sessions/<sid>/``, holding
``events.jsonl`` (opened and written by ``session/events.py``'s
``EventLog``; this module only reads it back) and ``meta.json`` (owned by
this module: the handful of facts ``events.jsonl`` cannot answer on its
own). ``<sid>`` is Mesh's own identifier, generated once by
``new_session_id`` and used as the directory name, the id ``-r`` lists and
accepts, and the key ``.mesh/state.json`` remembers for ``-c``. It is
never the same value as ``sdk_session_id``, which is the underlying
``claude`` CLI's own conversation id: the two are recorded side by side in
``meta.json`` because a session exists (and has a directory, an event
log, a place in ``-r``'s listing) before the SDK client has connected and
reported an id of its own, and because ``continue_conversation=True`` is
scoped to the CLI's notion of cwd (plan section 3.4) while a resume needs
an id that stays meaningful regardless of where this process happens to
be run from.

``meta.json``'s ``project_key`` is a defence against a ``.mesh/`` directory
copied or moved out of the project tree it was created for: it is computed
once, from the resolved project directory, at session creation, and every
lookup in this module recomputes the caller's own current project key and
refuses to resume or list a session recorded against a different one.
Resuming the wrong conversation under an id that looks right is worse than
reporting it as unknown.

Turn count and cost are derived from ``events.jsonl`` rather than kept a
second time in ``meta.json``: ``EventLog`` is already the one writer of
that file, and a count kept separately in ``meta.json`` would need someone
to update it in step with every turn, which is exactly the two-writer
hazard the front-end store contract elsewhere in this project exists to
avoid. ``first_user_text`` has no home in ``events.jsonl`` (nothing in
``session/base.py``'s ``AgentEvent`` set records what the human typed) and
is the one field this module keeps in ``meta.json``, written at most once
per session by ``record_first_user_text``.
